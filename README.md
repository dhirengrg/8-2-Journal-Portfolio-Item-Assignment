•	How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To write the program maintainable which means the program we created can maintain such as add more function, remove, or modify based on its usage. In the CRUD python module, we can add create, read, update, delete operation at any time and manage it so that it has benefits that should not be rewrite from the scratch level. The readable the program means the concepts of the code should be understandable using the comments. The benefits of to make it easy in future purpose as well. The programs that are adaptable is that the function or the program should be adaptable while interacting with different environment.

•	How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist to approach a problem understand the root of the problem and look for the possible outcome from multiple ways. In the case of Grazioso Salvare requested database or dashboard, I would go through the database and build up relating requirements along the way. This was different approach than any other course because this was based on mongo database working with both command on shell and code of python. I would use the mongo database and MySQL database as well for the future client’s request.

•	What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

The computer scientists do the developing the software, hardware and design it to the use it for the others as well for their own project as well. I would work this kind of project developing the attractive and reliable project that meets the client’s requirements and careful to the time frame as well as testing and deploying.
